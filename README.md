# TnTRFMod.ExclusiveAudio

Exclusive audio mod extracted from TnTRFMod for TnTRF.

Go to the release page to download the latest version.

If the mod does not work, please make sure you have the latest BepInEx installed. (Currently tested with BepInEx 6.0.0.be.738)

Copy the mod folder `net.stevexmh.TnTRFMod.ExclusiveAudio` into `BepInEx/plugins/` then when the mod is loaded, close the game and edit the config file in `BepInEx/config/net.stevexmh.TnTRFMod.ExclusiveAudio.cfg` then restart the game to make it work.

If you installed the TnTRFMod, you need to manually disable `EnableMinimumLatencyAudioClient` since this feature will conflict this mod.
